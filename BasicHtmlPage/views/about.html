		<p>
		basichtmlpage.info is made from my own wish: I wanted to create a simple HTML frame with the choice of various popular JavaScript frameworks (like jQuery). In the mean time I will be making little changes to the site like small and handy tools for web developers.
		</p>
		<p>
		The site is made with Node.js using the Express framework and is hosted on an Ubuntu Server machine.

		The site is made by <a href="http://www.duco.cc">Duco Winterwerp</a>. Do you have any suggestions? Send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:basichtmlpage@winterwerp.it">basichtmlpage@winterwerp.it</a>.
